# ja2tools - ja2MapTool
GUI tool for remapping tiles and item ids in JA2 map files. Also provides simple map and sti viewers, and a VFS browser.

Built using [mvvmFX](https://github.com/sialcasa/mvvmFX). Currently the the map tool violates the MVVM pattern so much, it's almost pornographic. I hope to fix that someday.
